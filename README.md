# Feature Requests

A repo to track all feature requests on EasyEngine project using Github issue tracker. 

## Guidelines

Below are some recommended way to make use of Github issue tracker as a tool to track "Feature Requests".

⚠️Please understand that we can not gurantee that any feature request will be fulfilled.

### Request a new feature 

Before you request a new feature, please [search issue tracker for open and closed issues](https://github.com/EasyEngine/feature-requests/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+).  

Please avoid creating a duplicate feature request. 

If you have a different perspective about an existing feature request, you may add details via comments on an existing feature.

### Voting

Please do not post +1 comments on an issue (feature request). 

You can use "add reaction" option instead to vote.

### Subscribe

You can watch entire repo but to watch an issue, better use "Subscribe" button on the right side. Again, no need to comment to get added to the notification list.

### Contribute a new feature 

If you like to work on as a developer on a feature request, please announce the intent first by commenting on the issue. This way we can avoid duplication of efforts.

### Sponsor a new feature 

If you like to sponsor development of a feature request, you may contact [rtCamp](https://rtcamp.com/contact). You can contact any other developer of your choice.

In the end, sponsoring a new feature doesn't gurantee that it will go inside core.

### Have a question?

If you still have a question about "feature requests", you can post it on the issue tracker here. 

It will help you can start the issue with word "[META]" so we understand the question is not a feature request itself.
